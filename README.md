# workshop-gpus
Materials for BEEVA Labs workshop on GPUs

access instructions
* each group will have access to a AWS GPU instance (we will provide the IP and private key)
* to access the instance:
  ```bash
  ssh -i workshop2017.pem ubuntu@<IP>
  ```
* to access the instance, enabling port redirection for jupyter notebook and mapd
  ```bash
  ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8888 -L 9092:127.0.0.1:9092 -i workshop2017.pem ubuntu@<IP>
  ```
